> sys.expose_access_log allows you to view the access log of a compromised system.

expose_access_log is a tier 1 upgrade.

## Stats

### cooldown

expose_access_log has a 'cooldown' stat, which is listed in seconds. After use, the upgrade will become unusable until the listed time has elapsed.

### count

The 'count' stat determines the upgrade's viewable number of entries in a compromised system's access log.

## Behavior

When a player has this upgrade loaded, the upgrade can be executed against a breached system using the following syntax:

```
>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
```

If a player attempts to execute this upgrade in an invalid use case, the upgrade will return corresponding errors.

Examples:

- Not in hardline:

```

>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
:::TRUST COMMUNICATION::: hardline required - activate with kernel.hardline

```

- Target system not breached:

```

>> sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
Failure
Target user.fakeloc123 is not a breached system.

```

- Upgrade on cooldown:

```
>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
Failure
sys.expose_access_log is still recalibrating. 12 minutes until ready.
```

- Not enough GC on system:

```
>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
Failure
Your account balance of 0GC is too low to send 50KGC.
```
