title: log_writer_v1
---

> sys.write_log allows you to write a log to a compromised system.

log_writer_v1 is a tier 1 upgrade. It spawns at 'noob', 'kiddie' and 'h4x0r' rarities.

## Stats

### Cooldown

The 'cooldown' stat, which is displayed in seconds, determines how much time must pass after use before the log_writer_v1 can be executed again.

## Behavior

Once an log_writer_v1 upgrade has been loaded, [[sys.write_log]] can be run against a breached system for a cost of 500KGC, which allows the breacher to leave a message in the target's [[access_log]]. The amount of [[GC]] required is displayed upon execution attempt. If the specific log_writer_v1 upgrade is on cooldown, an error containing the remaining cooldown time will be displayed upon execution attempt. For syntax information see [[sys.write_log]].

```
>>sys.write_log { target: "user.fakeloc123", msg: "you got hacked" }
Success

Transferred 500KGC to trust
```

A message left in logs:

```
240130.1829 you got hacked
240130.1829 sys.write_log execution from user.fakeloc234
```
