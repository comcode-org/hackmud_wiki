> sys.expose_access_log allows you to view the access log of a compromised system.

expose_access_log_v1 is a tier 1 upgrade. It spawns at 'noob', 'kiddie', and 'h4x0r' rarities.

## Stats

### cooldown

The 'cooldown' stat, which is displayed in seconds, determines how much time must pass after use before the expose_access_log_v1 can be executed again.

### count

The 'count' stat displays the number of access logs can be exposed by the expose_access_log_v1 being used.

## Behavior

When a player has this upgrade loaded, the upgrade can be executed against a breached system using the following syntax:

```
>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
```

If a player attempts to execute this upgrade in an invalid use case, the upgrade will return corresponding errors.

Examples:

- Not in hardline:

```

>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
:::TRUST COMMUNICATION::: hardline required - activate with kernel.hardline

```

- Target system not breached:

```

>> sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
Failure
Target user.fakeloc123 is not a breached system.

```

- Upgrade on cooldown:

```
>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
Failure
sys.expose_access_log is still recalibrating. 12 minutes until ready.
```

- Not enough GC on system:

```
>>sys.expose_access_log { target: "user.fakeloc123" }
Failure
Your account balance of 0GC is too low to send 50KGC.
```
