> sys.expose_access_log allows you to view the access log of a compromised system.

expose_access_log_v1 is a tier 1 upgrade. It spawns at 'noob', 'kiddie', and 'h4x0r' rarities.

## Stats

### cooldown

The 'cooldown' stat, which is displayed in seconds, determines how much time must pass after use before the expose_access_log_v1 can be executed again.

### count

The 'count' stat displays the number of access logs can be exposed by the expose_access_log_v1 being used.

## Behavior

Once an expose_access_log_v1 upgrade has been loaded, [[sys.expose_access_log]] can be run against a breached system for a cost of 50KGC. The amount of [[GC]] required is displayed upon execution attempt. If the specific expose_access_log_v1 upgrade is on cooldown, an error containing the remaining cooldown time will be displayed upon execution attempt. For syntax information see [[sys.expose_access_log]].
