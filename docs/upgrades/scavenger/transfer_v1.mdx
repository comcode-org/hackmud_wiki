> sys.xfer_gc_from allows you to transfer money out of a compromised system.

transfer_v1 is a tier 2 upgrade. It spawns at ((%1kiddie%)), ((%2h4x0r%)) and ((%3h4rdc0r3%)) rarities.

## Stats

### cooldown

Displays the amount of time in seconds before the script may be used again after it has been used.

### amount

Displays the maximum amount of money which can be transferred out.

## Behavior

Once transfer_v1 has been loaded, [[sys.xfer_gc_from]] can be used to target a breached system.
If the target system does not have enough GC to transfer the full amount, the script will return an error.
If the upgrade is on cooldown, an error containing the remaining cooldown time will be displayed upon execution attempt.
[[sys.xfer_gc_from]] can be executed using the following syntax:

```
sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.loc", amount: "<desired amount (up to max) as GC string>" }
```

If a player attempts to execute this upgrade in an invalid use case, the upgrade will return corresponding errors.

Examples:

- Not in hardline:

```

>>sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.loc", amount: "10KGC" }
:::TRUST COMMUNICATION::: hardline required - activate with kernel.hardline

```

- Target system not breached:

```

>>sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.loc", amount: "10M500KGC" }
Failure
Target user.loc is not a breached system.

```

- Upgrade on cooldown:

```
>>sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.loc", amount: "100B100MGC" }
Failure
sys.xfer_gc_from is still recalibrating. 12 minutes until ready.
```

- Amount is higher than the maximum allowed by upgrade:

```
>>sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.loc", amount: "10TGC" }
Failure
You can't transfer more than 10MGC
```

- Target has unsufficient funds:

```
>>sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.loc", amount: "10KGC" }
Failure
Target user account balance is too low to take 10KGC.
```
