> sys.xfer_gc_from allows you to transfer money out of a compromised system.

transfer_v1 is a tier 2 upgrade. Spawns at 'kiddie', and 'h4x0r' rarities.

## Stats

### cooldown

Displays the amount of time in seconds before the script may be used again after it has been used.

### amount

Displays the maximum amount of money which can be transferred out.

## Behavior

Once transfer_v1 has been loaded, [[sys.xfer_gc_from]] can be used to target a breached system.
If the upgrade is on cooldown, an error containing the remaining cooldown time will be displayed upon execution attempt.
[[sys.xfer_gc_from]] can be executed using the following syntax:

```
sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.fakeloc123", amount: "<desired amount (up to max) as GC string>" }
```

If a player attempts to execute this upgrade in an invalid use case, the upgrade will return corresponding errors.

Examples:

- Not in hardline:

```

>>sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.fakeloc123", amount: "10K000GC" }
:::TRUST COMMUNICATION::: hardline required - activate with kernel.hardline

```

- Target system not breached:

```

>> sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.fakeloc123", amount: "10M500KGC" }
Failure
Target user.fakeloc123 is not a breached system.

```

- Upgrade on cooldown:

```
>>sys.xfer_gc_from { target: "user.fakeloc123", amount: "100B100MGC" }
Failure
sys.xfer_gc_from is still recalibrating. 12 minutes until ready.
```
