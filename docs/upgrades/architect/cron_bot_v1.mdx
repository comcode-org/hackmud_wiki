> bot_brain upgrades will call your bot_brain script based on the upgrade's cooldown interval, allowing you to automate your user.

cron_bot_v1 is a tier 1 upgrade. It spawns at ((%0noob%)), ((%1kiddie%)), and ((%2h4x0r%)) rarities.

## Stats

### cooldown

The 'cooldown' stat displays the number of seconds between each bot_brain execution.

### cost

The 'cost' stat displays the amount of [[GC]] required to pay for bot_brain execution.

### retries

The 'retries' stat displays the number of execution errors allowed before the cron_bot_v1 unloads itself due to execution failure.

## Behavior

When a script called `bot_brain` is loaded on a user's system, a cron_bot_v1 is loaded, and the user is inactive, the cron_bot_v1 will attempt to execute the `bot_brain` script. If not enough [[GC]] is present on the system, or the number of retries has been exceeded, the cron_bot_v1 will unload itself. If user activity is detected, the cron_bot_v1's execution attempt will be delayed until the user is inactive again.
