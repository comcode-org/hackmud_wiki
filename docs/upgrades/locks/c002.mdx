> The CORE c002 adds slight protection over the 001. Still mediocre.

c002 is a tier 1 [[lock]] created by the CORE corporation.

## Stats

c002 has no additional stats. The upgrade only spawns at ((%1kiddie%)) rarity.

## Behavior

When loaded on a targetted [[loc]], the following text will be displayed when no arguments are provided:

```
>>user.loc { }
LOCK_ERROR
Denied access by CORE c002 lock.
```

When providing any truthy argument (or an empty string `""`), the lock will state that the correct color was not provided, unless the correct color is provided:

```
>>user.loc {c002:"not_a_color"}
LOCK_ERROR
"not_a_color" is not the correct color name.
```

Its second stage will state that the additional argument `c002_complement` is missing, or that its input isn't the correct color name.
