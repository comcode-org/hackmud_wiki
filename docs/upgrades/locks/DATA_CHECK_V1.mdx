DATA_CHECK_V1 is a tier 1 [[lock]].

## Stats

DATA_CHECK_V1 has one additional stat called 'acc_mod' which can modify what tier the question/answer pool draws from.
In other words, this stat determines the likelyhood that a DATA_CHECK_V1 will pull from a tier 2 pool rather than a tier 1 pool.

## Behavior

DATA_CHECK_V1 expects the answers to three questions concatenated together into a single string with no separator.

When no arguments are passed into DATA_CHECK_V1, the lock will return the following error:

```
user.loc { }
LOCK_ERROR
Denied access by DATA_CHECK lock.
```

Note that the '\_v1' at the end of DATA_CHECK is not included in the argument key.

Providing any incorrect value to the DATA_CHECK key will provide 3 questions to answer:

```
>>user.loc { DATA_CHECK:"" }
a ++++++ is a household cleaning device with a rudimentary networked sentience
safety depends on the use of scripts.++++++
pet, pest, plague and meme are accurate descriptors of the ++++++
```

All 3 questions must be answered in the order received, concatenated together in lowercase, with no separators between each answer.
