DATA_CHECK_V1 is a tier 1 [[lock]].

## Stats

DATA_CHECK_V1 has one additional stat called 'acc_mod' which can modify what tier the question/answer pool draws from.
In other words, this stat determines the likelyhood that a DATA_CHECK_V1 will pull from a tier 2 pool rather than a tier 1 pool.

## Behavior

DATA_CHECK_V1 expects the answers to three questions concatenated together into a single string with no separator.
When no arguments, or empty arguments are passed, DATA_CHECK_V1 will return the following lock error:

```
user.fakeloc123 { }
LOCK_ERROR
Denied access by DATA_CHECK lock.
```

Note that the '\_v1' at the end of DATA_CHECK is not included in the argument key.
