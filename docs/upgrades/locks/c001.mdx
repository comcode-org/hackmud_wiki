> The CORE 'c' line of locks provides entry level protection for the concerned consumer. The 001 is the first of that line.

c001 is a tier 1 [[lock]] created by the CORE corporation.

## Stats

c001 has no additional stats. The upgrade only spawns at '((%1kiddie%))' rarity.

## Behavior

When loaded on a targetted [[loc]], the following text will be displayed when no arguments are provided:

```
>>user.loc { }
LOCK_ERROR
Denied access by CORE c001 lock.
```

When providing any truthy argument (or an empty string `""`), the lock will state that the correct color was not provided, unless the correct color is provided:

```
>>user.loc { c001:"not_a_color"}
LOCK_ERROR
"not_a_color" is not the correct color name.
```
