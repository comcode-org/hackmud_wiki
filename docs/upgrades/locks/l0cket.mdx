l0cket is a tier 1 [[lock]] created by the NUUTEC SECURITY SYSTEMS corporation.

## Stats

l0cket includes one additional stat called 'count' which determines the range of solutions a given l0cket will accept. The lock spawns at rarities, noob, kiddie, and h4x0r.

## Behavior

l0cket expects one of several possible [[k3y_v1]] values to be passed as a string.
When an incorrect string is passed, l0cket will present the following error information:

```
user.loc { l0cket:"not_a_k3y" }
LOCK_ERROR
"not_a_k3y" is not the correct security k3y.
```
