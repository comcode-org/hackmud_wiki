> Halperyon Systems' EZ 40. Wait, I can't remember if 1 is prime or not.

ez_40 is a tier 1 lock created by the HALPERYON SYSTEMS corporation.

### Stats

This upgrade has no additional stats and only spawns at 'kiddie' rarity.

## Behavior

When encountered, the ez_40 will ask for a string on its first parameter, and a digit (number) on its second parameter.

### Incorrect Parameters

```
>>user.loc { ez_40: true }
LOCK_ERROR
true is not a string.

>>user.loc { ez_40: "release", ez_prime: "1" }
LOCK_ERROR
"1" is not a number.

Correct parameters:

>>user.loc { ez_40: "release" }
LOCK_ERROR
Required unlock parameter ez_prime is missing.

>>user.loc { ez_40: "release", ez_prime: 2 }
LOCK_ERROR
2 is not the correct prime.
```
