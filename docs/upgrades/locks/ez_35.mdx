## Description

Halperyon Systems' EZ 35. A step up from the 21, but not much.

### Stats

ez_35 has no additional stats. The upgrade only spawns at 'noob' rarity.

## Behavior

When encountered, the lock expects a string as its first parameter, and a digit as its second. Each parameter will return corresponding errors if an incorrect data type is input.

## Solving

  The first parameter's possible strings are, "open", "unlock", and "release". The
  second parameter is a single digit, input as a number, ranging from 0 to 9.
