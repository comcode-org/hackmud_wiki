l0ckbox is a tier 2 [lock](/upgrades/locks) created by the NUUTEC corporation.

## Stats

l0ckbox includes one additional stat called 'count' which determines the range of solutions a given l0ckbox will accept. The lock spawns at rarities ((%1kiddie%)), ((%2h4x0r%)), and ((%3h4rdc0r3%)).

## Behavior

l0ckbox expects one of several [[k3y_v1]] or [[k3y_v2]] upgrades to be loaded.
When no k3y or the incorrect k3y is loaded, the lock will present the following error information:

```
user.loc {}
To unlock, please load the appropriate k3y: tvfkyq
```
