> c003 from CORE. Additional complexity, additional cost.

c003 is a tier 1 [[lock]] created by the CORE corporation.

## Stats

c003 has no additional stats. The upgrade only spawns at ((%1kiddie%)) rarity.

## Behavior

When loaded on a targetted [[loc]], the following text will be displayed when no arguments are provided:

```
>>user.loc {}
LOCK_ERROR
Denied access by CORE c003 lock.
```

When providing any truthy argument (or an empty string `""`), the lock will state that the correct color was not provided, unless the correct color is provided:

```
>>user.loc { c003: "not_a_color" }
LOCK_ERROR
"not_a_color" is not the correct color name.
```

## Solving

c003 requires three arguments to fully solve: (( %Nc003%, %Nc003_triad_1%, and %Nc003_triad_2%. ))

The (( %Nc003_triad_1% )) and (( %Nc003_triad_2% )) arguments are the [color triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme#Triadic) of the color specified in the (( %Nc003% )) argument. (( %Nc003_triad_1% )) and (( %Nc003_triad_2% )) are strings, and come from the same list of colors as (( %Nc003%. ))
