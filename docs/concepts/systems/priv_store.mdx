_- Unknown, ((marks.lost_and_found))_

((%Cpriv_store%)) is a special user that does not take a user slot, cannot be retired, and cannot run any scripts other than ((accts.balance)) or ((accts.xfer_gc_to)).

It can be accessed by entering ((%Cpriv_store%)) or ((%Cuser% %Apriv_store%)) into the CLI.

A ((%Cpriv_store%)) user is named similar to an NPC, and can hold up to ((1B337MGC)).

A ((%Cpriv_store%)) user cannot be attacked or breached as it does not have a loc.

You can transfer ((%CGC%)) to your ((%Cpriv_store%)) with ((accts.xfer_gc_to \{ to:"priv_store" \})),
but only when calling it directly in the CLI. Subscripts cannot target ((%Cpriv_store%)).

To target your ((%Cpriv_store%)) in a subscript call, you must enter the actual name of your ((%Cpriv_store%)) user.

## Edge Cases & Notable Behaviours

Attempting to send any amount of ((%CGC%)) to a ((%Cpriv_store%)) that is not associated with your account will always return the following irregardless of the balance of the ((%Cpriv_store%)) user:

> ((%DFailure%))\
> User can't store that much ((%CGC%)). Recipient must init to tier 2.

Attempting to send ((%CGC%)) to your ((%Cpriv_store%)) when it is full will return the following, including when the transfer is subscripted:

> ((%DFailure%))\
> balance would exceed the priv_store limit of 1B337MGC
