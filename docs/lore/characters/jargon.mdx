```

### farm / farming

```
The (usually automated) process of scraping NPCs and cracking them.

```

### golf / golfing

```

### implementation detail

An upgrade that defends your system. Common examples are ez_21, ez_35, etc.

```

### lock rotation

```

### Lockstack

```
The locks equipped on your user

```

### MITM

```

```

### rotation

All public and not hidden scripts are assigned to a sector. Sectors can be listed with scripts.fullsec, scripts.highsec, ... To view the scripts in a sector, you must join that sector's channel, e.g. if you want to see the scripts in FORM_ALPHA_0, you must join the chat channel FORM_ALPHA_0. After joining that sector's chat channel, you can view the scripts in it with scripts.<seclevel> {sector:"<that sector>"}

```

### sentience

```

### shift

```
The process that assigns a script to a sector. Shifting a script takes 15 minutes, and is required with any sec level change of a public script, or when first making a script public.

```

### stuck NPCs

```
An informal description of a language, meaning that it (at least usually) doesn't use strong typing but instead relies on, for example, anything that has an x and y property being essentially a 2D point. If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck. JS is (mostly) duck-typed.
