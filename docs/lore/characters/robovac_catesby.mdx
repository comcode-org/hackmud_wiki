## Description

robovac_catesby is a robovac. He seems to like teapots. He also flashes lights a lot.

## Brief Summary of character

robovac_catesby was the ring leader for robovac_revolution_v1. While silent through the first, and missing in the second, revolution, he begins to take a more center stage appearance in later events. He becomes a tea pot and hosts some tea parties during the ministry of dust. I can't really remember much more.
