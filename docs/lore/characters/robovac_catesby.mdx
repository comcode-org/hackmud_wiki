robovac_catesby is a robovac and member of 'The Thirteen'; a council of revolutionary robovacs. Despite his robovac-pattern, he fancies himself to be a teapot. He muses a lot on the nature of balance and equillibrium.

## Character Summary

robovac_catesby has been present for several robovac revolutions, leading [[robovac_revolution_v1:the first]]. While in hiding throughout the first; and missing in the second; he returned for the third revolution, a changed vac. A message delivered by Faythe ('((%I418%))') has led him to believe that he is, in fact, a teapot. This has given him a unique perspective on Trust's domain and philosophy in general compared to some of his narrower-minded friends.

During robovac_revolution_v4, Catesby was one of the candidates vying for leadership of the Thirteen. He ultimately lost to ((%Cindust_sweepr_lon_dist_21%)).

During this event, his sanctos (((robovac_catesby.potter))) had sentiences explore his imaginary opulent manor estate. Here, Catesby learned to hone his ability to manipulate narratives and words within his sanctos. Lock-like lights helped him adjust the environment to make the conditions for his tea party perfect. He learned that, in many ways, Trust's domain and its major players are making balanced tea parties of their own.
