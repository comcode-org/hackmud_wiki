## store_list

### STORE ERROR: account is too new

New accounts may only make purchases via ((%Cstore_list%)) after 3 days.

### STORE ERROR: unknown

This error is typically indicative of an untrusted Steam account. Unfortunately, the reason for this error is often difficult to dianogse.

- The Steam account usually must exist for at least 30 days
- The Steam account needs to have purchased at least $5 of things on Steam, from a real credit/debit card
- Accounts occasionally seem to be 'blacklisted' by Steam. If this happens, the account cannot ever be trusted
  - Steam support has historically not assisted in this matter. Creation of a new account is the only known solution thus far
