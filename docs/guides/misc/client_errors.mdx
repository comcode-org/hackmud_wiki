Documentation for various known errors in the client.

## store_list

### STORE ERROR: account is too new

New hackmud accounts may only make purchases via ((%Cstore_list%)) after 3 days.

### STORE ERROR: unknown

'unknown' store errors are errors which are hidden from the client for security reasons.

Often, this error is indicative of an _untrusted_ Steam account. Unfortunately, the reason for an _untrusted_ Steam account is difficult to diagnose.

- The Steam account usually must exist for at least 30 days.
- The Steam account needs to have purchased at least $5 of things on Steam, from a valid payment method.
- Steam accounts occasionally will be in a permanent state of _untrusted_ by Steam.
  - It is not clear if VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) bans or game bans cause this.
  - Steam support has historically not assisted in this matter. Creation of a new Steam account is the only known solution thus far.
  - In this case - once a new Steam account is created - please contact hackmud support by joining [the discord](https://discord.gg/QRTXHaz) and creating a support ticket. ComCODE can assist you in re-associating your hackmud account with the new Steam account.
