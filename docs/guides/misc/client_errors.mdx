title: Known Client Errors
---

Documentation for various known errors in the client.

## There was a critical error processing your request. 992

Indicative of general issues with the client communicating with the server. There is often additional data alongside the error.

992 errors are often a client-side issue, and are intermittent in nature.

## 401 Unauthorized

### Steam Auth Failure

hackmud could not communicate with Steam to authenticate to your account. This usually can be the result of:

- Steam maintenance (happens most often on Tuesdays)
- Account not being logged into Steam
- Steam being closed on your operating system
- Launching the hackmud exectuable directly instead of through steam

Make sure Steam & your OS are up-to-date (might need a restart) and that you have a stable connection to Steam

### Your account has been banned

Your account is banned from hackmud. A reason and expiration time is given in the error message.

To appeal your ban, ((%cappeal instructions go here%))

## 403 Forbidden

### Timestamp validation failed

hackmud requires the operating system's clock to be properly set to its closest timezone. Check that your system clock is congruent with https://time.is

## no client output

If there is no client output after launching the game, this is typically indicative of a man-in-the-middle (such as a censoring ISP) blocking the connection to hackmud.

Please check that your web browser can access https://hackmud.com; for more guidance, please open a support ticket on [the discord](https://discord.gg/QRTXHaz).

## 503 Maintenance

hackmud is offline for planned maintenance. Please visit [the discord](https://discord.gg/QRTXHaz), Steam announcements or [Twitter](https://x.com/hackmudgame) for updates.

## 405 Method Not Allowed

Sometimes occurs during scheduled maintenance periods instead of a 503.

## store_list

### STORE ERROR: account is too new

New hackmud accounts may only make purchases via ((%Cstore_list%)) after 3 days.

### STORE ERROR: unknown

'unknown' store errors are errors which are hidden from the client for security reasons.

Often, this error is indicative of an _untrusted_ Steam account. Unfortunately, the reason for an _untrusted_ Steam account is difficult to diagnose.

- The Steam account usually must exist for at least 30 days.
- The Steam account needs to have purchased at least $5 of things on Steam, from a valid payment method.
- Steam accounts occasionally will be in a permanent state of _untrusted_ by Steam.
  - It is not clear if VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) bans or game bans cause this.
  - Steam support has historically not assisted in this matter. Creation of a new Steam account is the only known solution thus far.
  - In this case - once a new Steam account is created - please contact hackmud support by joining [the discord](https://discord.gg/QRTXHaz) and creating a support ticket. ComCODE can assist you in re-associating your hackmud account with the new Steam account.

## The script run caused a garbage collection timeout

A script execution was not able to clean up the memory used during execution in the maximum amount of time provided. This generally occurs while scraping tier 3 corporations. In this specific instance, running a script for only up to 2500ms is a known workaround.

## -unexpected error has been hidden-

The error you encountered has not been vetted for security, and has been hidden. If you ever see this error, raise a support or sandbox ticket on [the discord](https://discord.gg/QRTXHaz)
