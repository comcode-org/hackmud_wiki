title: Auto-retirement for Inactive Users

Documentation for hackmud's automatic inactive account retirement.

## Accounts with no activity for a duration of 60 days will automatically retire all users

In order to preserve performance of the Multi-User Domain over time, it is necessary to remove users and records from the database. Users that belong to accounts which have gone inactive for 60 days will automatically retire.

## Email Reminders

Players who wish to be notified of retirement can sign up for reminder emails by linking your steam account to the [hackmud forums](https://hackmud.com/forums).

## No Auto-retirement for Elite Supporters
