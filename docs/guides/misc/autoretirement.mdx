title: Auto-retirement for Inactive Users
---

Documentation for hackmud's automatic inactive account retirement.

## Accounts with no activity for a duration of 60 days will automatically retire all users

In order to preserve performance of the Multi-User Domain over time, it is necessary to remove users and records from the database. Users that belong to accounts which have gone inactive for 60 days will automatically retire.

To avoid auto-retirement, it is sufficent to log into the account, once you do so the timer will be reset for all users associated with that account.

## Email Reminders

Players who wish to be notified of retirement can sign up for reminder emails by linking your steam account to the [hackmud forums](https://hackmud.com/forums).
