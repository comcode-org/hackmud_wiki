title: Supporter Model and Benefits
---

The [ComCODE Supporter Model](https://givebutter.com/QncoAxxT2tdWf3UfJ2x95z25n1HNizxI) intends to provide a way for anyone to support ComCODE's long term development of hackmud.

By supporting [ComCODE](https://comcode.org/) you are making a donation to ComCODE, a 501(c)-3 Non-Profit, on a monthly recurring basis. This will help us to achieve our goal of financial sustainability, so that we can continue to deliver on our mission.

For more information about becoming a Supporter, and our Supporter Benefits, visit [our Supporter Campaign Page](https://givebutter.com/QncoAxxT2tdWf3UfJ2x95z25n1HNizxI).
