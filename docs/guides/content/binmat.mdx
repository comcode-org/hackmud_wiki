**Binary Matrix** (often shortened to 'BINMAT') is a resource management minigame, used as a last line of loc defense in _hackmud_. Interaction with BINMAT in-game can be challenging without prior knowledge; which this guide hopes to help with.

## What are the rules for BINMAT?

Since BINMAT also exists as a game external to _hackmud_, an in-depth 'Human Compatible Rulebook' exists here:

[https://github.com/comcode-org/binmat_rules](https://github.com/comcode-org/binmat_rules)

This guide pertains primarily to interacting with BINMAT in-game. It will thus not cover the specifics of the rulebook, unless in-game implementations meaningfully deviate from the rulebook above.

Another popular, community-ran resource to play low-risk BINMAT games online is [https://binm.at](https://binm.at). This website features a partial hands-on tutorial for learning the game, as well as bot users like Mallory to play against.

## Where do I find BINMAT?

BINMAT is a feature only found on the locs of player-controlled users. There is currently only one NPC known to be equipped with BINMAT: ((walter.entry_vdnpgt))

In order to obtain BINMAT on a user, you must successfully win a game of BINMAT as an attacker against a defender. After the defending system is breached, your system will be automatically augmented with the 'BINMAT security shell'. 

A common method of obtaining BINMAT is to breach ((walter.entry_vdnpgt)). He does not play any defensive moves and is therefore generally trivial to breach. 

:::warning

It is worth noting that Walter tends to be frequently monitored by players, and your [[sys.loc:loc]] will be inside of Walter's [[sys.access_log:access log]] when attempting to hack him.

:::warning

The BINMAT Security Shell - and the consequences of it being enabled - cannot be disabled once unlocked on a given system.
