The ((%QMarks System%)) is a means of tracking your progression through hackmud. This guide will aim to explain what the ((%QMarks System%)) is, what to expect and how to progress through ((%Qmarks%)).

### What Are Marks?

((%QMarks%)) (known also as '((%Qprotocol certification marks%))') are an indicator of sentience quality. The earliest '_Required Marks_' function as hackmud's tutorial and early-game content, gating access to a number of Trust scripts - as well as arbitrary user script execution - until you establish and demonstrate a strong understanding of Trust's domain.

### How do I access locked scripts?

Many scripts in [[scripts.trust:((scripts.trust))]] - as well as all other scripts uploaded by users - will be locked behind completing a relevant mark challenge. Currently, the ((%Qcontext%)) mark gates the execution of arbitrary user scripts, plus Trust scripts that are not otherwise unlocked during Required Marks.

Running a locked script will inform you of what challenge you must complete to unlock it, including ones which you may not yet have access to.

```
>>accts.balance
:::TRUST COMMUNICATION::: You must complete marks.accts to access this functionality.
```

### What Marks can I do?

Marks that you are currently able to start will be displayed in [[marks.available:((marks.available))]]:

```
>>marks.available
Top level marks are available to earn now, run marks.<mark_name> to begin a mark
To view progress see marks.protocol

> marks.input
  |
  \---- kiddie_pool
```

### How do I see my progress?

Progress through the Marks System is displayed through your ((%Qprotocol%)), which can be viewed at any time with [[marks.protocol:((marks.protocol))]]:

### How do I skip the Marks System?

Required marks can be skipped at any time by running [[marks.sync:((marks.sync))]]. This will fast-forward through every required mark, unlocking all Trust scripts as well as arbitrary user script execution.

Users which had already migrated out of the vLAN before the introduction of the Marks System will be treated as having completed the Required Marks progression already.

### Hidden Marks

An unknown amount of hidden marks are available to be achieved. These are typically for completing challenges in high-tier content, solving puzzles or performing other obscure actions. Hidden marks are not revealed in [[marks.available:((marks.available))]] before being earned.

Currently, hidden marks do not explain how they were obtained, or when they were obtained, inside [[marks.protocol:((marks.protocol))]].

### Trust Script Info

Documentation for ((%Qmark%))-related Trust scripts are available below:

- [[marks.protocol:((marks.protocol))]]
- [[marks.available:((marks.available))]]
- [[marks.sync:((marks.sync))]]
