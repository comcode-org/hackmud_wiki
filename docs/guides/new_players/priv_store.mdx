_- Unknown, ((%Fmarks%.%Qlost_and_found%))_

((%Cpriv_store%)) is a special user that does not take a user slot, cannot be retired, and cannot run any scripts other than ((accts.balance)) or ((accts.xfer_gc_to)).

It can be accessed by entering ((%Cpriv_store%)) or ((%Cuser priv_store%)) into the CLI.

A ((%Cpriv_store%)) user is named similar to an NPC, and can hold up to ((1B337MGC)).

A ((%Cpriv_store%)) user cannot be attacked or breached as it does not have a loc.

You can transfer ((%CGC%)) to your ((%Cpriv_store%)) with ((accts.xfer_gc_to \{ to:"priv_store" \})),
but only when calling it directly in the CLI. Subscripts cannot target ((%Cpriv_store%)).

To target your ((%Cpriv_store%)) in a subscript call, you must enter the actual name of your ((%Cpriv_store%)) user.
