## The trading system

In hackmud, trading is an alternative method to exchange resources between users, and the only method of exchanging ((%Fbits ⌽%)) between players.

Instead of using ((accts.xfer_gc_to)) and ((sys.xfer_upgrade_to)), trading uses the ((%Ctrade%)) shell command, and has its own special interface and fees.

### Starting a trade

The syntax for starting a trade is ((%Ctrade% %Auser%)). This will send a trade request to the inputted user, and they must do the same, with your name.

#### Example

`angie` wishes to trade with `bo`, so `angie` sends `bo` a trade request:

```
>>trade bo
Success
```

`bo` then sees the trade request, and accepts:

```
trade request received. begin trade with trade angie

>>trade angie
Success
```

At which point both parties then see the trade interface appear:

```
║ trade 68b1152c50334a086f9b258e ║
╙━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╢
angie offers                     ║ bo offers
━━━                              ║ ━━━
                                 ║
-- EMPTY --                      ║ -- EMPTY --
                                 ║

make trade offers with trade_bits, trade_gc, trade_add
for usage see trade_help
```

A trade has begun.

### Making offers

((GC)), upgrades, and ((%Fbits ⌽%)) can be offered using the commands outlined in ((%Ctrade_help%)).

There will be a trade fee based on what is offered, which is outlined later in detail.

#### Commands

The commands for making offers, as shown in ((%Ctrade_help%)):

```
trade_bits <bit amount>             [sets your offered bits amount]
trade_fee <0 or 1>                  [selects which user pays the trade fee]

trade_gc <GC num or string>         [adds GC to your offers]

trade_add <upgrade index>           [adds an upgrade to your offers]
trade_rem <upgrade trade index>     [removes an offered upgrade from your offers]
trade_up_info <upgrade trade index> [shows detailed upgrade information for an offered upgrade]
```

### Concluding a trade

Trades can end in two ways: both parties accept the trade and the resources are exchanged, or one party runs ((%Ctrade_end%)) and no resources are exchanged.

### Fees

Use of the trade system incurs a fee, paid with ((%Fbits ⌽%)). The minimum trade fee is ((%F3⌽%))

The fee is based on the resources exchanged on completion of the trade - not all resources present - with the following calculations:

- 4% of ((%Fbits ⌽%)) exchanged;
- 30% of ((%JB%%CGC%)) exchanged;
- Upgrade rarity, based on the below table;

|       Rarity       | Fee Amount  |
| :----------------: | :---------: |
|    ((%0noob%))     |  ((%F3⌽%))  |
|   ((%1kiddie%))    |  ((%F3⌽%))  |
|    ((%2h4x0r%))    |  ((%F3⌽%))  |
|  ((%3h4rdc0r3%))   | ((%F15⌽%))  |
| ((%4\|\_\|b3\|2%)) | ((%F30⌽%))  |
|    ((%531337%))    | ((%F150⌽%)) |

### Notes

- You cannot offer something the other party is unable to hold.
- You can trade among your own users, but you cannot offer ((%Fbits ⌽%)).
- The trade system can exceed the ((32BGC)) xfer limit.
- Each party appears to only be able to offer 1 upgrade.
