## The trading system

In hackmud, trading is an alternative method to exchange resources between users, the only method of exchanging ((%Fbits ⌽%)), and the process through which ((%Tqubits ⓠ%)) are realised.

Instead of using ((accts.xfer_gc_to)) and ((sys.xfer_upgrade_to)), trading uses the ((%Ctrade%)) shell command, and has its own interface and fees.

## Starting a trade

The syntax for starting a trade is ((%Ctrade% %V\<user>%)). This will send a trade request to the inputted user, and they must do the same, with your name.

To trade as a corp representative, replace ((%Ctrade%)) with ((%Ctrade_corp%)).

### Example

`angie` wishes to trade with `bo`, so `angie` sends `bo` a trade request:

```
>>trade bo
Success
```

`bo` then sees the trade request, and accepts:

```
trade request received. begin trade with trade angie

>>trade angie
Success
```

At which point both parties then see the trade interface appear:

```
║ trade 68b1152c50334a086f9b258e ║
╙━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╢
angie offers                     ║ bo offers
┗ AS SELF                        ║ ┗ AS SELF
━━━                              ║ ━━━
                                 ║
-- EMPTY --                      ║ -- EMPTY --
                                 ║

make trade offers with trade_bits, trade_gc, trade_add
for usage see trade_help
```

A trade has begun.

## Making offers

((%CGC%)), upgrades, ((%Fbits ⌽%)), and ((%Tqubits ⓠ%)) can be offered using the commands outlined in ((%Ctrade_help%)).

There will be a trade fee based on what is offered, which is outlined later in detail.

### Commands

The commands for making offers, as shown in ((%Ctrade_help%)):

```
trade_bits <bit amount>             [sets your offered bits amount]
trade_fee <0 or 1>                  [selects which user pays the trade fee]

trade_gc <GC num or string>         [adds GC to your offers]

trade_add <upgrade index>           [adds an upgrade to your offers]
trade_rem <upgrade trade index>     [removes an offered upgrade from your offers]
trade_up_info <upgrade trade index> [shows detailed upgrade information for an offered upgrade]
```

### Offering qubits (and corp donations)

To offer ((%Tqubits ⓠ%)) for realization, you use the same command as when offering ((%Fbits ⌽%)) (((%Ctrade_bits%))), and ((%Tqubits ⓠ%)) will be offered first, given the current trade is a corp donation.

To be a "corp donation", the following criteria must be met:

- Exactly one party is acting as a corp
- The non-corp party is offering ((%Fbits ⌽%)) (((%Fbits ⌽%)) and ((%Tqubits ⓠ%)) are treated the same)
- No other items are offered by either party

Corp donations have no trade fee.

When ((%Tqubits ⓠ%)) are offered in a donation and the trade is completed, the offered ((%Tqubits ⓠ%)) will be realized as ((%Fbits ⌽%)) in the corp's "bits purse".

## Concluding a trade

Trades can end in two ways: both parties accept the trade and the resources are exchanged, or one party runs ((%Ctrade_end%)) and no resources are exchanged.

## Fees

Use of the trade system incurs a fee, paid with ((%Fbits ⌽%)). The minimum trade fee is ((%F3⌽%))

The fee is based on the resources exchanged on completion of the trade - not all resources present,

The trade fee will be reduced if the involved parties are corp representatives or COMCODE supporters.

These fee reductions apply as "stacks" - multiple instances of criteria being met will reduce the fee further.
For example: both parties being supporters will apply two "stacks" of fee reduction.

Corp representative and COMCODE supporter criteria are not mutually exclusive, allowing for up to 4 stacks of fee reduction when both parties are supporters and trading as corps.

Corp donations (outlined above) have no fee.

If fee reduction criteria are met, it will be displayed in the trade UI.

### Bits

The fee on an exchange of bits is calculated as a percentage of the bits exchanged, with the following values:

| Reduction Stacks | Fee %  |
| :--------------: | :----: |
|        0         |   5%   |
|        1         |   4%   |
|        2         |   3%   |
|        3         |   2%   |
|        4         |   1%   |
|  Corp donation   | No fee |

### GC

The fee on an exchange of ((GC)) is calculated as a percentage of the ((BGC)) exchanged, with the following values:

| Reduction Stacks | Fee % |
| :--------------: | :---: |
|        0         |  50%  |
|        1         |  40%  |
|        2         |  30%  |
|        3         |  20%  |
|        4         |  10%  |

### Upgrades

The fee on an exchange of upgrades is based on the rarity of the upgrades, with the following values:

|       Rarity       | 0 Reduction | 1 Reduction | 2 Reduction | 3 Reduction | 4 Reduction |
| :----------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
|    ((%0noob%))     | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  |
|   ((%1kiddie%))    | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  |
|    ((%2h4x0r%))    | ((%F5 ⌽%))  | ((%F4 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  | ((%F3 ⌽%))  |
|  ((%3h4rdc0r3%))   | ((%F25 ⌽%)) | ((%F20 ⌽%)) | ((%F15 ⌽%)) | ((%F10 ⌽%)) | ((%F5 ⌽%))  |
| ((%4\|\_\|b3\|2%)) | ((%F50 ⌽%)) | ((%F40 ⌽%)) | ((%F30 ⌽%)) | ((%F20 ⌽%)) | ((%F10 ⌽%)) |
|    ((%531337%))    |   ERR404    |   ERR404    |   ERR404    |   ERR404    |   ERR404    |

## Notes

- You cannot offer something the other party is unable to hold.
- You can trade among your own users, but you cannot offer ((%Fbits ⌽%)).
  - With the exclusion of corp \<-> user and corp \<-> corp trades.
- The trade system can exceed the ((32BGC)) xfer limit.
- Each party appears to only be able to offer 1 upgrade.
- Fees of rarity 5 upgrades are currently undocumented.
- Fee reduction stacks are counted based on the users.
  - A supporter doing a trade between their own users (no corp parties) would have 2 stacks of fee reduction, not 1.
