Some notes about the information contained within the name of an NPC.

## NPC Name Structure

As you may have noticed by now, NPC names have a certain "shape" or "look" to them:

```
derelict_jrttl_pavv79
unknown_ddttl_cfarmn
uknown_jrttl_6u7yxp
anonymous_jrwlf_v53yfr
```

The name of an NPC has 3 primary "components" to it, with the structure looking something like this:

```
[prefix]_[specs]_[id]
```

The part we care about is the `specs` section.

## How to read an NPC's specs

The `specs` section consists of 5 characters, which contain 2 pieces of information: "difficulty", and class.

### Difficulty

The first two characters denotes the strength of an NPC's lockstack, with the possible values in ascending order being:

1. jr - junkrack
2. dd - diggerdeck
3. wb - wreckbox
4. pr - phreakyrack (??)
5. ls - leetstack

These names relate to the assessment of lockstack strength visible in ((sys.specs)).

### Class

The last three characters denote the NPC's class. It is an abbreviation of the class you get when you load types of upgrades, not the upgrade type.
Think how `infiltrator` upgrades make you a `wolf`, and `architect` upgrades make you a `weaver`.

The values are as follows:

| NPC | Class  |  Upgrades   |
| :-: | :----: | :---------: |
| ttl | turtle |    locks    |
| wlf |  wolf  | infiltrator |
| wvr | weaver |  architect  |
| rvn | raven  |  scavenger  |
| stg |  stag  |  executive  |

## What Do I do with this?

If for some reason this information doesn't seem immediately useful, I'll give you some reasons why it is.

Being able to determine an NPC's class is helpful when grinding for certain types of upgrades. Need k3y upgrades? Look for `wlf`. Locks? `ttl`. Script space? `wvr`.

Being able to determine an NPC's approximate difficulty can be helpful if you know your cracker can't handle some things,
or if you don't have a lot of k3ys,
or are trying to get tier 2 payouts from NPCs with tier 1 locks.
A lot of things.
