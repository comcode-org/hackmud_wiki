Macros allow users to create shorthand for fast execution of otherwise long commands.

### How to create/use a macro

Creating a macro is done with the format `/macro = original.script`. Pre-defined parameters can also be applied. For example:

- `/bal = accts.balance`
- `/hl = kernel.hardline`
- `/dc = kernel.hardline { dc:true }`

Once the macro has been created, it can be used by simply typing `/<macro name>`. For instance, typing `/bal` will run ((accts.balance)).

### Macros with custom arguments

By using double braces, you can set up your macros to allow for custom arguments. You can reference specific arguments (seperated by spaces) using each argument's index, like `{0}`, `{1}`, and `{2}`. For example:

- `/xfer = accts.xfer_gc_to {{ to:"{0}", amount:{1} }}`

With the above macro, typing `/xfer trust 500` would run ((accts.xfer_gc_to)) \{ ((%Nto%)):((%V"trust"%)), ((%Namount%)):((%V500%)) \}

To reference an argument that uses spaces - e.g. a chat message - use `{$}`, which references any argument not already specified by a number index. For example:

- `/chat = chats.send {{ channel:"{0}", message:"{$}" }}`

With this macro, typing `/chat 0000 This is a chat message!` would call ((chats.send)) \{ ((%Nchannel%)):((%V"0000"%)), ((%Nmessage%)):((%V"This is a chat message!"%)) \}

### View current macros

Typing `/` by itself will show a list of the current user's macros.

```
>>/
/bal = accts.balance
/hl = kernel.hardline
/dc = kernel.hardline { dc:true }
```

### Delete a macro

To delete an existing macro, type `/macro =` with nothing after the `=`.

```
>>/bal =
Macro deleted.
```

## Macro storage on disk

### What's a macro file?

Macros in hackmud are stored in a file per user, which is located in the same place as `shell.txt`.

> Run ((%C#dir%)) and go two folders up. Or navigate to:
>
> > Windows - `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\hackmud`\
> > macOS - `~/.config/hackmud`\
> > Linux - Either `~/.config/hackmud` or the game folder.

The naming scheme is `username.macros`, and are plain text files.

### Workaround: Sharing macros between users

Because macros are scoped to users by default, when you switch to another user, you can't use the first user's macros.

One of the ways you can solve this is with the concept of a symlink: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link

By adding a symlink to a source file for macros, each user would be editing and reading from the same file, allowing macros to be shared between users.

:::warning
When mucking with files always back them up before accidentally doing destructive actions.

#### How to set up a symlink on Windows

Windows 10 and later have access to `mklink`: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink

Here's an example of mapping / copying macros from user_a's macros to user_b's macros.

:::note
Running mklink requires a windows command prompt which has been started with administrator permissions.
:::

```
USAGE:
mklink abs_path_to_new_link_file file_path_to_link_to

COMMAND:
mklink "C:\Users\southr6\AppData\Roaming\hackmud\user_b.macros" "C:\Users\southr6\AppData\Roaming\hackmud\user_a.macros"
```

#### How to set up a symlink on macOS & linux

To make a symlink these unix-based platforms, we're going to use the `ln` command.

:::note
Syntax may differ depending on your OS, check `man ln` for usage differences.  
Also note, the parameters are in different orders in windows and unix.
:::

We want to run `ln` with the `-s` options, with the source file being the path to the file containing the macros, and the target file being the path to the `username.macros` in the previously mentioned directory.

For example on macOS, my ln usage and command looked like this:

```
USAGE:
ln [options] source_file new_link_file

COMMAND:
ln -s ~/Developer/hackmud/southr6/workshop/macros.txt ~/.config/hackmud/southr6.macros
```
