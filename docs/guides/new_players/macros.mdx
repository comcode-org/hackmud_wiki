Macros allow users to create shorthand for fast execution of otherwise long commands.

### How to create/use a macro

Creating a macro is done with the format `/macro = original.script`. Pre-defined parameters can also be applied. For example:

- `/bal = accts.balance`
- `/hl = kernel.hardline`
- `/dc = kernel.hardline { dc:true }`

Once the macro has been created, it can be used by simply typing `/<macro name>`. For instance, typing `/bal` will run ((accts.balance)).

### Macros with custom arguments

By using double braces, you can set up your macros to allow for custom arguments. You can reference specific arguments (seperated by spaces) using each argument's index, like `{0}`, `{1}`, and `{2}`. For example:

- `/xfer = accts.xfer_gc_to {{ to:"{0}", amount:{1} }}`

With the above macro, typing `/xfer trust 500` would run ((accts.xfer_gc_to)) \{ ((%Nto%)):((%V"trust"%)), ((%Namount%)):((%V500%)) \}

To reference an argument that uses spaces - e.g. a chat message - use `{$}`, which references any argument not already specified by a number index. For example:

- `/chat = chats.send {{ channel:"{0}", message:"{$}" }}`

With this macro, typing `/chat 0000 This is a chat message!` would call ((chats.send)) \{ ((%Nchannel%)):((%V"0000"%)), ((%Nmessage%)):((%V"This is a chat message!"%)) \}

### View current macros

Typing `/` by itself will show a list of the current user's macros.

```
>>/
/bal = accts.balance
/hl = kernel.hardline
/dc = kernel.hardline { dc:true }
```

### Delete a macro

To delete an existing macro, type `/macro =` with nothing after the `=`.

```
>>/bal =
Macro deleted.
```

### Macros and symlinks

Macro files (`username.macros`) can also be symlinks to another file and still work, assuming the file contents are valid.

This can be used for:

- Having macros backed up somewhere other than the game folder
- Having macros synced across many users
- Showing off just how nerdy you are

#### What's a macro file?

Macros in hackmud are stored in a file, which is located in the same place as `shell.txt`.

> Try using running ((%C#dir%)) and going two folders up. Or navigating to:
> > Windows - `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\hackmud`\
> > macOS - `~/.config/hackmud`\
> > Linux - Either `~/.config/hackmud` or the game folder.

The naming scheme is `username.macros`, and are plain text files.

#### How symlink?

((%D:::This is written by a mac user, so I have no idea if the below is true for Windows:::%))

To make a symlink, we're going to use the `ln` command.

***PLEASE BACKUP YOUR MACROS FILES AND CHECK `man ln`, THE USAGE MAY DIFFER FOR YOU***

We want to run `ln` with the `-sfn` options, with the source file being the path to the file containing the macros, and the target file being the path to the `username.macros` in the previously mentioned directory.

For example, my ln usage and command looked like this:

```
USAGE:
ln [options] source_file target_file

COMMAND:
ln -sfn ~/Developer/hackmud/southr6/workshop/macros.txt ~/.config/hackmud/southr6.macros
```
