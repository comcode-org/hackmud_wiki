Macros allow users to create shorthand for fast execution of otherwise long commands.

### How to create/use a macro

Creating a macro is done with the format `/macro = original.script`. Pre-defined parameters can also be applied. For example:

- `/bal = accts.balance`
- `/hl = kernel.hardline`
- `/dc = kernel.hardline { dc:true }`

Once the macro has been created, it can be used by simply typing `/<macro name>`. For instance, typing `/bal` will run ((accts.balance)).

### Macros with custom arguments

By using double braces, you can set up your macros to allow for custom arguments. You can reference specific arguments (seperated by spaces) using each argument's index, like `{0}`, `{1}`, and `{2}`. For example:

- `/xfer = accts.xfer_gc_to {{ to:"{0}", amount:{1} }}`

With the above macro, typing `/xfer trust 500` would run ((accts.xfer_gc_to)) \{ ((%Nto%)):((%V"trust"%)), ((%Namount%)):((%V500%)) \}

To reference an argument that uses spaces - e.g. a chat message - use `{$}`, which references any argument not already specified by a number index. For example:

- `/chat = chats.send {{ channel:"{0}", message:"{$}" }}`

With this macro, typing `/chat 0000 This is a chat message!` would call ((chats.send)) \{ ((%Nchannel%)):((%V"0000"%)), ((%Nmessage%)):((%V"This is a chat message!"%)) \}

### View current macros

Typing `/` by itself will show a list of the current user's macros.

```
>>/
/bal = accts.balance
/hl = kernel.hardline
/dc = kernel.hardline { dc:true }
```

### Delete a macro

To delete an existing macro, type `/macro =` with nothing after the `=`.

```
>>/bal =
Macro deleted.
```
