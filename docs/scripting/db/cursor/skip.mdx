Set the skip count of the cursor.

## Syntax

```
let cursor = #db.f(query, projection)
cursor.skip(skip)
```

### Parameters

#### skip

The number of results to skip.
Note that this is not cumulative; `cursor.skip(5).skip(1)` will skip 1 document, not 6.

### Return

Returns a new cursor, with the same handle as the input cursor.

This can be used to chain into other methods.

## Cursor State

This function keeps the cursor open.
