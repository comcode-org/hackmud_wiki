title: "#db.i(..)"
---

Add new document(s) to the database.

Similar to a [MongoDB db.collection.insert()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insert/), with some syntax restrictions

## Syntax

```js
#db.i(<documents>)
```

## Arguments

### documents

An object (or list of objects, one per argument) representing documents to be inserted

## \_id

If not specified, #db.i(..) will add an _\_id_ key-value pair to your document on insertion, containing an [ObjectId](db.objectid). This is to ensure that there is at least 1 unique property to each document

If an \_id is included in the inserted document, that \_id will be used. This has unique advantages in hackmud, because the \_id field is _indexed_ in user database collections, resulting in significantly faster querying times from other database functions.

:::warning

If a document is inserted containing an \_id that already exists in the user's database, a :::TRUST COMMUNICATION::: will be raised:

`:::TRUST COMMUNICATION::: E11000 duplicate key error collection: hackmud*production.[user] index: \_id* dup key: { : [id value] } (11000)`

Any other documents inserted alongside the errant document will still be inserted.

## Return Data

An object is returned upon inserting one or many documents into the database, providing extra details about whether it succeeded:

| Key    | Information                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| n      | Number of documents inserted                                                      |
| ok     | If the operation succeeded, == 1                                                  |
| opTime | Object that contains a property 't' -- time of insertion operation in millieconds |

Other values are returned, but provide no additional usable data due to undefined conversions

## Example

```js
function(context, args) {
  return #db.i({type:"my_data", my_key:"foo"},{type:"my_data", my_key:"bar"})
}
```
