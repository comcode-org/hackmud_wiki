Trust scripts are scripts provided by Trust herself, and thus can be trusted to act as-described. Probably. ((%D:)%))

In the hackmud shell, trust scripts are rendered with a "((%Fsafety orange%))" username, like "[((sys.upgrades))](/scripting/trust_scripts/sys.upgrades)". It is advised to verify this before pressing enter!

Public Trust scripts can be listed in-game using [((scripts.trust))](/scripting/trust_scripts/scripts.trust). Trust scripts will also show "TRUST" in [((scripts.get_access_level))](/scripting/trust_scripts/scripts.get_access_level) (or ((trust: true)) when subscripted)
