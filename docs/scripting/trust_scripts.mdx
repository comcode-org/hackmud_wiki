Trust scripts are scripts provided by trust herself. So you can trust them. Probably. ((%D:)%))

In the Hackmud shell, trust scripts are rendered with a "((%FSafety Orange%))" username, like "[((trust.me))](/scripting/trust_scripts/trust.me)." If you are trying to run a trust script at the shell, make sure you see the ((%FSafety Orange%)) before you press enter!

You can list the trust scripts using [((scripts.trust))](/scripting/trust_scripts/scripts.trust).

Trust scripts will also show "TRUST" for [((scripts.get_access_level))](/scripting/trust_scripts/scripts.get_access_level) (or ((trust: true)) for scripts.)
