{
  time: "231219.1732",
  amount: "20MGC",
  sender: "user",
  recipient: "trust",
  script: null
}
{
  time: "231219.1732",
  amount: "20MGC",
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
{
  time: "231216.0626",
  amount: "10MGC",
  sender: "user",
  recipient: "trust",
  script: null
}
{
  time: "231216.0626",
  amount: "10MGC",
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
```

#### Script

Called as a subscript, ((accts.transactions)) returns an array of objects. '((%Ntime%))' is a JavaScript `Date` object.

```js
{
  time: "2023-12-19T17:32:35.651Z",
  amount: 20000000,
  sender: "user",
  recipient: "trust",
  script: null
}
{
  time: "2023-12-19T17:32:34.158Z",
  amount: 20000000,
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
{
  time: "2023-12-16T06:26:52.131Z",
  amount: 10000000,
  sender: "user",
  recipient: "trust",
  script: null
}
{
  time: "2023-12-16T06:26:51.912Z",
  amount: 10000000,
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
```

## Example

Using the same transaction log from above:

```js
function(context, args)
{
	let transactions = #hs.accts.transactions({ count: 4, from: "trust" })
	return transactions
}
```

Since we have specified that we would like our return to include transactions from trust out of a list of 4 total transactions, this example would filter our list down to the following:

```js
{
  time: "2023-12-19T17:32:34.158Z",
  amount: 20000000,
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
{
  time: "2023-12-16T06:26:51.912Z",
  amount: 10000000,
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
```
