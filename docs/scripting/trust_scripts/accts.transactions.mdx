### Return

#### CLI

```
>>accts.transactions
To see more items, add count:<"all" or number>, start:<number>
To filter recipients, add to:"<username>"
To filter senders, add from:"<username>"
To filter by script, add script:"<scriptname>"
{
  time: "231219.1732",
  amount: "20MGC",
  sender: "user",
  recipient: "trust",
  script: null
}
{
  time: "231219.1732",
  amount: "20MGC",
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
{
  time: "231216.0626",
  amount: "10MGC",
  sender: "user",
  recipient: "trust",
  script: null
}
{
  time: "231216.0626",
  amount: "10MGC",
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
```

#### Script

Same as CLI but without usage information.

## Example

Using the same transaction log from above:

```
function(context, args)
{
	let transactions = #hs.accts.transactions({count:4,from:"trust"})
	return transactions
}

```

Since we have specified that we would like our return to include transactions from trust out of a list of 4 total transactions, this example would filter our list down to the following:

```
{
  time: "231219.1732",
  amount: "20MGC",
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
{
  time: "231216.0626",
  amount: "10MGC",
  sender: "trust",
  recipient: "user",
  script: "trust.example_script"
}
```
