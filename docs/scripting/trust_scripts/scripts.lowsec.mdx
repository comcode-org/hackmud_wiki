scripts.lowsec
```

### Script

```
#fs.scripts.lowsec()
```

### Parameters

#### sector

The 'sector' argument specifies the lowsec sector to be shown.

#### CLI

No arguments:

```
>>scripts.lowsec
specify & join a sector to see a list of the scripts in that sector.
```

The listed sectors are dynamic and will change over time. Running scripts.lowsec on the CLI will return 4 columns of sector names. Specifiying a sector will return the scripts which are currently in that sector.

```
function(context, args)
{
	return #fs.scripts.lowsec({ sector: "CHAOS_LAMBDA_1" })
}
```
