### Security Level

FULLSEC

## Syntax

### CLI

```
scripts.fullsec
```

### Script

```
#fs.scripts.fullsec()
```

### Parameters

#### sector

The '((%Nsector%))' argument specifies the fullsec sector to be shown.

### Return

```

The listed sectors are dynamic and will change over time. Running ((scripts.fullsec)) on the CLI will return 4 columns of sector names. Specifiying a sector will return the scripts which are currently in that sector.

{
	return #fs.scripts.fullsec({ sector: "VOID_LAMBDA_2" })
}
