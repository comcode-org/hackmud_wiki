title: Supported Unicode
alias:
  - unicode
description: "Officially-supported Unicode characters"
---

Although many unicode symbols display in-game, unsupported unicode characters are rendered using a fallback font in the client, instead of the game's primary White Rabbit font. The fallback font often breaks cursor alignment or word-wrapping. They are also not guaranteed to work on all platforms. Unsupported unicode characters are best avoided in script and chat outputs.

The following characters are used officially in-game and thus are expected to work properly. Some of the characters use codepoints that unicode assigns to existing symbols. These are noted after the hex codes.

| Char | Escape        | Original Unicode                                                        |
