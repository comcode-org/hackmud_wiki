title: Return Object
alias:
  - success object
  - failure object
---

An object returned to the CLI from a script may be automatically formatted, depending on its contents. These types of objects are often referred to as ((%LSuccess%)) or ((%DFailure%)) objects.

## Syntax

A ((%LSuccess%)) or ((%DFailure%)) object can only contain two keys. The `ok` key is required, and determines whether ((%LSuccess%)) or ((%DFailure%)) is displayed in the terminal. You may also attach a `msg` key, which will append that value, after being converted to a string.

## Example

```js
function(context, args) {
    //Explains the guessing game when the script is run without a guess.
    if (!args.guess) {
        return "Let's play a guessing game! Guess a number between 1 and 10!"
    }

    //Return a success object if they guess they right number.
    if (args.guess == Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)) {
        return {
            ok: true,
            msg: args.guess + " was the right number!"
        }
    }

    //In all other cases, return a failure object.
    return {
        ok: false,
        msg: "Sorry, please guess again!"
    }
}
