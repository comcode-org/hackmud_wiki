title: Context Object
---

The first argument to the script function is known as the "context object" or "context".

## Syntax

The context object always contains the following keys:

- `caller`: the name of the user that initiated this script execution, as string.
- `calling_script`: the full name of the script that called this script, as a string. This is only filled if the script was called via [[subscript]]. If the script was called from the CLI or via scriptor, this value is (( %Vnull% )) instead.
- `this_script`: the full name of this script, as a string.
- `cols`: the width of the main shell in the client running this script in characters, as a number. If called by automation (such as a [[cron_bot]] execution), (( %V128% )) is used.
- `rows`: the height of the main shell in the client running this script in characters, as a number. If called by automation, (( %V64% )) is used.

The following properties may also be present:

- `is_scriptor`: (( %Vtrue% )) if the script is being run via a scriptor.
- `is_brain`: (( %Vtrue% )) if the script execution was started by a [[cron_bot]].

## Examples

```js
{
  caller: "myuser",
  calling_script: null,
  this_script: "myuser.test_script",
  cols: 125,
  rows: 78
}
```

```js
{
  caller: "mycron",
  calling_script: null,
  this_script: "mycron.bot_brain",
  is_brain: true,
  cols: 128,
  rows: 64,
}
```

```js
{
  caller: "myuser",
  calling_script: "myuser.other_script",
  this_script: "myuser.test_script",
  cols: 125,
  rows: 78
}
```

```js
{
  caller: "myuser",
  calling_script: null,
  this_script: "myuser.test_script",
  is_scriptor: true,
  cols: 125,
  rows: 78
}
```
