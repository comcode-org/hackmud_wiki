## Syntax

Simple input is when a script is called in the CLI, but instead of an object being given, the script is just followed by text:

```
user.script wow, such input
```

Simple input is passed into the called script's args object as a string with the key ((%Ninput%)).

## Examples

If a script is run with the following simple input;

```
user.script simple Input
```

The contents of that script's args would be: 

```
{input: "simple Input"}
```

A script that takes a simple input and returns that simple input would contain the following code:

```js
function(context, args) {

  return args.input

}
```

And with the above input, the output would be:

```
simple Input
```
