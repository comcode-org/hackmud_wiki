ID of the top-level script execution.

_RUN_ID is a global variable that contains a MongoDB [[ObjectId]] generated at the beginning of the top-level script run. This ID is used for [[sys.access_log:((sys.access_log))]] and other game functions, but is also accessible to users at any security level through this variable.

## Syntax

```js
_RUN_ID
```

## Example

A script that wants to check the Run ID of the current top-level script execution can do so with _RUN_ID:

```js
function(context, args) {
  return _RUN_ID // 660f983a3c341078abe70ba2
}
```
