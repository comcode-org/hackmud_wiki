Debugging output function.

#D - or 'Debug' - is a function that will take any content you input to it and add it to a debug log. At the end of the script run - if you are the script owner - all of the debug logs will be returned instead of the regular output. This output will be returned even if the script hits an uncatched error or ((%D:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::%))

:::info

#D will suppress regular script output for the script owner.

Only the script owner sees the output of #D - it is not a substitute for `return`ing regular output for any other user.
:::

## Syntax

```js
#D(input)
```

## Arguments

### input

The input to be added to the debug log output. If this value is not a string, #D will attempt to turn it into a string. #D will also return its input as an output.

## Example

This script uses #D to debug the flow of the script run

```js
function(context, args) {
  #D("started")

  let x = 2
  #D(x)
  let y = 3
  #D(y)

  return #D(x + y)
}
```

Anybody who is not the script owner will see the following output:

```
5
```

The script owner will see the following output:

```
started
2
3
5
```
