title: "#G"
---

Global object that persists across a top-level script execution.

#G - or 'Global' - is a global object unique for every script. It starts empty `{}` and can have any properties added to it over time that the script owner desires. If the script is called multiple times in a single top-level script execution, the contents of #G will persist.

Each script only sees its own #G object and cannot interact with other #G's.

## Syntax

```js
#G // {}
#G.foo = "bar"
#G // {foo:"bar"}
```

## Arguments

#G behaves like any other JavaScript object. The [builtins which apply to JS objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) similarly apply to #G

## Example

This script wants to cache a [[db.f:database lookup]] that is reused when called multiple times. It is written like so:

```js
function(context, args) {
  if(!#G.data){
    #G.data = #db.f({type:"my_data"}).first()
  }

  if(#G.data.foo == "bar") return "baz"
  else return "quz"
}
```

When first called in a top level script run, the script will spend time performing a database lookup with [[db.f:#db.f]], then in subsequent calls the lookup will be skipped, saving precious runtime.
