### Security Level

## Syntax

### CLI

```
scripts.fullsec
```

### Script

```
#fs.scripts.fullsec()
```

### Parameters

#### sector

The 'sector' argument specifies the fullsec sector to be shown.

### Return

#### CLI

No arguments:

```
>>scripts.fullsec
specify & join a sector to see a list of the scripts in that sector.
```

The listed sectors are dynamic and will change over time. Running scripts.fullsec on the CLI will return 4 columns of sector names. Specifiying a sector will return the scripts which are currently in that sector.

#### Script

The listed sectors are dynamic and will change over time. Calling scripts.fullsec as a subscript will list one column of sector names by default. Specifiying a sector will return the scripts which are currently in that sector.

## Example

Note: the example sector may not be a valid sector.

```
function(context, args)
{
	return #fs.scripts.fullsec({ sector: "VOID_LAMBDA_2" })
}
```
