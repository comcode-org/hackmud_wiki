title: _START

alias:
  - _ST
  - START

Timestamp of the beginning of the top-level script run.

\_START (along with \_ST) are global variables that provide a timestamp, in milliseconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), of when the script execution began.

## Syntax

```js
_START;
_ST;
```

## Example

A script that wants to track how long their own execution has taken can use \_START:

```js
function(context, args) {
  // do stuff

  return "Ran for " + (Date.now() - _START) + " ms"
}
```
