title: "_END"

alias: END
---

Timestamp of the latest possible end of the top-level script execution.

\_END is a global variable that provides a timestamp, in milliseconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), of when the script execution is guaranteed to end due to a timeout. This number is effectively [[_START]] + [[_TIMEOUT]].

## Syntax

```js
_END;
```

## Example

A script that wants to check how close it is to timing out can use \_END instead of \_START + \_TIMEOUT or [((scripts.lib))](../scripts_lib)'s [[can_continue_execution]]:

```js
function(context, args) {
  // do stuff

  if(_END - Date.now() < 500){
    return "Less than 500ms left! Bailing!"
  }

  // do more stuff

  return "Script completed without timing out"
}
```
