title: _TIMEOUT

alias:
  - _TO
  - TIMEOUT

How long, in milliseconds, a script may run for before timing out.

\_TIMEOUT (along with \_TO) are global variables that provide the length of time, in milliseconds, that a top-level script execution is allowed to run for before being terminated. It is currently `5000`.

## Syntax

```js
_TIMEOUT;
_TO;
```

## Example

A script that wants to check how close it is to timing out can use \_TIMEOUT along with [[_START]], [[_END]], [Date.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) or [((scripts.lib))](../scripts_lib)'s [[can_continue_execution]]:

```js
function(context, args) {
  // allow for at least 500ms of runtime
  let bail_after_ms = (_TIMEOUT - 500)

  // do stuff

  if((Date.now() - _START) > bail_after_ms){
    return "Less than 500ms left! Bailing!"
  }

  // do more stuff

  return "Script completed without timing out"
}
```
