CON_SPEC is a tier 2 [[lock]] created by the context corporation.

## Stats

CON_SPEC has 2 additional stats, one of which is 'p1_len' which controls the length of the solved character string and the other is 'p2_len' which controls how long the string is that is returned to the scriptor. The lock spawns at rarities ((%1kiddie%)), ((%2h4x0r%)), and ((%3h4rdc0r3%)).

## Behavior

CON_SPEC expects the answer to one of two questions. One requires you to pass a scriptor, another needs you to find the next three letters in a sequence.

```
>>user.loc {CON_SPEC:""}
GHIJKLM
Provide the next three letters in the sequence

>>user.loc {CON_SPEC:""}
Provide a scriptor <number>({s:<string>, d:<number>}) which returns the number of times the digit shows up
in the string
```

You either need to pass in some characters that can be found by finding the pattern in the letters, or you need to pass in a scriptor based on what the lock gives you.
